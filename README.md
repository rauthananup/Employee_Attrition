# About Project 
This dashboard presents an attrition analysis conducted on employees within a company. The purpose of this analysis is to assist organizations in formulating strategies aimed at reducing attrition rates. These strategies may involve enhancing employee engagement, implementing more effective training and development programs, offering competitive compensation and benefits packages, and fostering a positive work environment.

# Introduction
Attrition analysis involves studying and comprehending the factors that contribute to employee departures from a company or organization. Elevated attrition rates can have negative consequences, including higher expenses related to recruiting, onboarding, and training new hires, as well as decreased productivity and employee satisfaction. The analysis aims to uncover the root causes of employee turnover, such as dissatisfaction with their jobs, insufficient compensation and benefits, limited opportunities for career advancement, ineffective leadership and management practices, and concerns related to workplace culture. By understanding these factors, organizations can develop strategies to address them and mitigate attrition.
